> Solving the Word Ladder Game Using the UCS Algorithm, Greedy Best First Search, and A*

## General Information
Word ladder (also known as Doublets, word-links, change-the-word puzzles, paragrams, laddergrams, or word golf) is a word game that is well known to all groups. Word ladder was discovered by Lewis Carroll, a writer and mathematician, in 1877. In this game, players are given two words called a start word and an end word. To win the game, players must find a chain of words that can connect the start word and end word. The number of letters at the start word and end word is always the same. Each adjacent word in the word chain can only differ by one letter. In this game, the optimal solution is expected, namely the solution that minimizes the number of words included in the word chain. The following is an illustration and game rules.
